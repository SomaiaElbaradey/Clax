\section{Conclusion}
\hspace{2cm} Transportation is an important part of our daily lives.
Thus, we did our best trying to solve one of its common problems that we almost face everyday.
Some multi-national and national companies and some national start-ups have already founded actual solutions to this problem specifically, but they usually worked on the private transportation means only.
Thus, we tried hard to work on the governmental transportation means to make this solution available to as many citizens as possible.
Usually, the services of private companies and start-ups don't cover all governorates or all cities, while our service can serve all governorates and all cities.
We put into consideration the passengers on highways and the passengers in remote areas.
